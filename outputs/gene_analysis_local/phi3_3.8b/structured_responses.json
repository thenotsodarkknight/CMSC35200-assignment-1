In the study, we employed formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue microarrays from 52 patients diagnosed within two years to evaluate TRAIL expression levels and correlate them with clinical features such as age at diagnosis, menopausal status, tumor stage (I-IV), FIGO prognostic staging system (a=13.9%, b=40% poor risk; c 26.5%, d=8.3% good/intermediate risk) and patient outcome as well with immunohistochemical analysis of TRAIL expression in a subset of patients including normal ovarian tissue (n = 17). The median duration from initial diagnosis to death was calculated according to the Kaplan Meier method for each prognostic FIGO category, and then compared between all groups with nonparametric test. TRAIL expression in tumor cells is associated with advanced stage of disease (stage III-IV) as well as poorer outcome after curative surgery irrespective of age or menopausal status but does not correlate significantly to histological grade nor BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation positivity. This study demonstrates that TRAIL could serve a valuable prognostic marker in ovarian cancer, particularly for women with advanced disease presenting at the time when curative surgery is still possible and would be of clinical interest to improve outcome further.",
